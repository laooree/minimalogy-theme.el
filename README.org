#+title: Minimalogy Theme
#+author: laooree
#+description: A GNU Emacs theme with multiple color schemes, with a reduced color count.

This theme tries to minimize the number of colors used, avoiding the Christmas-tree effect (which I find distracting and cognitively demanding) that Nicolas P. Rougier talks about in [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06030][this paper]].
The theme is using a reduced set of colors as faces, as done in [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-theme][N Î› N O Theme]]. The flagship color scheme, Understory, is heavily based on [[https://github.com/daut/miasma-theme.el][Miasma theme]].

* Installation


** Using =use-package=
You can use Emacs =vc-use-package= to install it from github:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package minimalogy-theme
    :ensure t
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/laooree/minimalogy-theme.el")
    :config
    (setq minimalogy-color-scheme 'understory)
    (load-theme 'minimalogy :no-confirm-loading))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can download the theme file and then:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package minimalogy-theme
    :ensure nil
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/"
    :config
    (setq minimalogy-color-scheme 'understory)
    (load-theme 'minimalogy :no-confirm-loading))
#+end_src

** Manual
Download the theme file, then:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "/themes/"))
  (setq minimalogy-color-scheme 'understory)
  (load-theme 'minimalogy t)
#+end_src

* Usage
To change the color scheme, you can set the variable =minimalogy-color-scheme=. Currently, only the flagship color scheme is supported:
- ='understory=
